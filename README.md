# This project contains a neural network for traffic signs classification built on Keras.

All the code is in the jupyter notebook and the dataset is located in the data folder. The other images are just for use in the examples throughout the code explanation.

The image dataset have a .p extension (Pascal source code) and for that we'll use the pickle library to help us.

The notebook also contains the entire explanation of the code, so you can have a better understand of it.
